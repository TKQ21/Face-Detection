Face Detection
Author: Mohd Kaif

This project demonstrates a conceptual computer vision pipeline
for detecting human faces in images. The implementation focuses
on understanding face detection workflows using pre-trained models
and AI-assisted tools.

# Pipeline Overview:
# 1. Load input image
# 2. Convert image to grayscale
# 3. Apply face detection model
# 4. Identify face regions (bounding boxes)
# 5. Display detected faces
